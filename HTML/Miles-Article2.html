										  <p>The average American household products 7.5 tons of carbon dioxide a year and the average car produces six tons of carbon dioxide a year, America as a whole produces around a fourth of the world's carbon dioxide.  Knowing this, the United States has vowed to cut CO2 emissions in half as well as China and the United Kingdom leaving only one percent for the rest of the world. Most people would agree that it is a step in the right direction but larger steps must be taken in order to keep the planet's greenhouse gases at a safe level. <br> <br>
 
The green house gas effect is the main contributor to global warming and the current crisis we are in involving the polar ice caps but environmental  is not the only concern, the health of the average American is also at risk. The greenhouse effect is the planet over heating because of trapped gases being kept in the planet by the ozone layer. <br> <br>

 Most Americans do not believe in climate change because people think that the science has not been researched enough to provide answers. The amount of carbon dioxide poisoning has increased in the past three years, according to the CDC. The health risk to people from third world countries has increased because of the increasing amount of greenhouse emissions  produced by first world countries. Dr. Tuner of the EPA states that â€œMost people do not realize the effects that greenhouse gasses including your specific one carbon dioxid are having on the evermentent, In the next 50 to 60 years or shorter smaller islands can be submerged under water". As of 2013, 82% of the greenhouse gases in America have resulted from human activity.  The majority of the green house gasses in the United States come from electricity a total of 37%, and the other big contributor is from car emissions with a total of 33% of car emissions.  The way we could help fix our problem regarding carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses is to keep informed. Keep taking message to limit the amount that you personally produce.
