										  <p>North Korea is notoriously known for the treatment of their people, it's not hard to see that this country is not going to last for 20 years, due to the external threats it receives from outside enemies who have strong military capabilities. <br> <br>
According to the U.S Passport and International Travel Association, tourists who enter the country who have been subject to arrest in the past for offenses such as talking to the North Korean public, having unauthorized photos, or being part of a tour group may suffer consequences. Being arrested for any violations in North Korea will result in the detainee being put in a labor or death camp. All communications within the country as well as communications going in or out of the country, is monitored by the government. <br> <br>
The current leader Kim Jong Un simply does not have enough support from the people or does not have enough control over the people like his father Kim Jong Il did.  <br> <br>
According to Bae-ho Hand a doctor in North Korea, "North Korea has less than half of their original resources," showing how little natural resources they have, and how it will negatively affect the survival of North Korea.
North Korea is very strict with what their citizens are allowed to do, but government officials do not have as many restrictions. Most people don't know the term "3 generations of punishment," it is the act of committing a crime and having your whole family taken and put into a labor camp. This ruling is passed down to the other family members in the next three generations. There has been an estimated 1,382 executions in North Koreaâ€™s death camps between the years 2000 and 2013.<br> <br>
North Korea is in a new category when it comes to lack of human rights all from of freedom the louse of punishments are treated with the most severe punishments not even member of the royal family are safe when kim jong un executed his own uncle after he was scared that he could gain power. <br> <br>
It also simply does not have enough resources such as metals, salts, food and medical supplies  to support itself with its most popular resource gold, made useless by the their terrible trading policies with the outside world. It simply does not have enough resources to exist within the next 20 years unless North Korea opens up vastly, changing the way the country has operated for the past 60 years. Will North Korea exist in 20 years? It probably will not exist due to the limited amount of resources it has, and the growth of smuggled outside information into North Korea, which will lead to the country opening up to the outside world to receive exported resources, leading to easy accessibility of outside information to North Korean citizens. The people will find out about the dictatorship and fight it.
