      <p>DaVinci is overflowing with young talent. We always showcase this talent around campus, but many say we don't do it nearly enough. For those people, and for anyone who enjoys seeing beauty all around campus, we now have Campus Improvement. It's a cornerstone and pillar of DVC's school culture Each week, we will find a different place at DaVinci and make it even DaVinci-er. This can be anything from an artistic paint job, upgrading DVC's tech, or even putting rockets under Eynon's class and making it fly!

<h1>This week</h1>
<p>I failed to get the blue lunch tables painted purple to match with the umbrellas. Here's how:</p>

<br><br>
<p>
First, I went to Mr. Barrymore's office. You can usually find the answers to anything school related in there. Unfortunately, Nathan wasn't in the office at the time. I returned to class. I sat in my chair and brainstormed ideas for what to do next. I started researching paint and the levels to the game. Turns out the tables weren't painted in the first place because of paint issues. So i went to work researching facts about paint to help our situation.</p><br>

<hr size="6" color="purple"><div class=”transcript”>[Transcript of a cell phone conversation with a Home Depot Paint Expert(HDPE)]

Me: Hello, how are you?<br>
HDPE: Fine, thanks. Did you have a question about paint?<br>
Me: So there's a group of tables outside at our school<br>
HDPE: Okay<br>
Me: They need to be painted with a finish that won't crack and will be easy to clean. <br>
HDPE: High gloss paint is the most durable paint. It is also difficult to apply correctly.<br>
Me: Well, what do I need to know?<br>
HDPE: Sand the surface before you paint. When you apply the paint, apply it with lengthwise strokes and let dry for 24-36 hours before application of the second coat.<br>
Me: Thanks, have a good day and enjoy a complimentary CINNABON™ .<br></div>

 <br>
<hr size="6" color="purple">
<p>My sources confirm that high gloss paint is the most durable paint, so that's the one I recommended to Nathan when we met. Unfortunately, the next day, Nathan told me that John said getting the tables painted would be “impossible” to clean. I sat down at a table and accepted defeat. After that I opened this laptop and started to type this beautiful article.</p>
<h1>My Experience</h1>
<p>This week I had plenty of good experiences with this assignment. This week I had plenty of bad experiences with this assignment. I think on good experience was the meeting with Mr. Barrymore. That meeting made everything seem like things were doing well, but unfortunately things didn't come to fruition. I think the lowest point was when the word “impossible” was used. The most interesting part of the week for me was learning about the different paints and their optimal applications. If I ever wanted to paint a high-gloss door, I would know exactly what to do. 
I think i knew then that this week's article would be a huge failure. But we do have some concept art of what the finished tables would look like.</p>
<br><br><p>concept art</p><br><br>
Still, I believe we should somehow get the tables painted. In this study here: <a href="http://99u.com/articles/17437/the-perfect-workspace-according-to-science" target="_blank"> Purple is rated as a combination of the performance effect of red and the creative effect of blue. </a> Also, in this study here:, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0040333" target="_blank"> the conclusion is reached that matching colors in areas promotes efficiency and synergy. </a> <br><br>

<br><i>A concept of another companion tables that would clearly elevate our school to a much greater level!! At a very affordable price of FREE! Campus Improvement.
<hr size="3" color="purple">

To go more in depth about these studies, they specifically say that art and beauty in the workplace was the driving factor behind the increases in efficiency. Colors would draw up performance increases in different areas. Here is a chart

</head>
<body>

<table id="customers">
  <tr>
    <th>Red</th>
    <th>Blue</th>
    <th>Purple</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Increased efficiency in high-performance tasks</td>
    <td>Had no effect on high performance tasks</td>
    <td>Increased efficiency in high-performance tasks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Negatively affected timed tasks</td>
    <td>Positively affected timed tasks</td>
    <td>Positively affected timed tasks</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sharply increased performance in creative tasks</td>
    <td>Increased performance in creative tasks</td>
    <td>ncreased performance in creative tasks</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br><br><br>
<p>Form the table above, we can conclude that purple increases performance in all tasks. It seems they would be an invaluable asset to all of DVC's students who work on them regularly. They would be a beautiful landmark to show guests and visitors to the school.<p>

  <li>The project should be finished before the article starts production.</li>
