				<div class="Bio-Story">
				<p> Musa is a junior at Da Vinci Communications, who was born in LA. He went to Jordan at the age of 1 and was raised there until the age of 8. 
				As a youngster, Musa's joy was brought to him by sports and video game consoles like the N64 and the PS1. 
				When he moved back to LA, basketball and studying the history of countries were added to his hobbies.
				As the captain of his varsity basketball team, Musa states that hardwork and dedication are key to being succesful. 
				As he notices corruption in today's society, Musa has dedicated himself to finding out and spreading the truth to people around him. </p>
