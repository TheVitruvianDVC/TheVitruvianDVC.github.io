										  <p>Parents all over the world send their children to school thinking they are in the safe hands of their teachers.  Little do the parents know, that teachers are not required to stay up to date with their CPR certification.  CPR stands for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, it can be performed in many emergencies, some of which include cardiac arrest or drowning. CPR keeps blood flowing to the brain and other vital organs. <br>  
It’s scary to think that there could be an emergency, and a teacher wouldn’t be able to assist the child. Most teachers think that after learning CPR once, that they will be prepared and won't need to renew their certification.  The truth is that they may forgotten some aspects, or CPR techniques have changed to be more efficient. <br>
Some may argue that they would rather wait for trained professionals to provide medical assistance.  
Assistant Professor of Health Science/Emergency Medical Science at University of Arkansas Monte Gagliardi says public school teachers are a very effective first-response during disasters and other emergencies in school, so it is important that they are up to date on their CPR.  Waiting trained professionals could possibly be even more harmful to the <br>
	I conducted a survey to see how parents and students  felt about teachers being required to be up to date on their CPR certification.100% of the parents that took the survey thought it was very important for teachers to be up to date on their CPR certification and assumed that all teachers were in fact up to date. 80% of students also had assumed the teachers were up to date and thought it was  important. This shows that parents should be more aware when sending their children to school. <br>
		We need to push schools to make it mandatory for teachers to stay up to date on their CPR.  Schools should fund CPR programs for teachers, and also give an extra compensation for teachers since they are taking their time out of their life to learn CPR.
