										<center><i>Smoking cigarettes is a way to negatively affect air pollution. Cigarettes are known to have 4,000 chemicals that they are made up of, also 43 cancer-causing compounds in them. <br> <br>
	
Smoking cigarettes are very effective to the person smoking them, but also is effective to the people around the smoke. Being affiliated with people that smoke could physically affect others, but what about  emotionally and mentally? <br> <br>

 Smoking is spreading rapidly. People have impacted others to smoke which is increasing air pollution quicker than a car running on diesel gas. <br> <br>
	
Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gas which pollutes the air. "The air pollution emitted by cigarettes is 10 times greater than diesel car exhaust." Medical News Today   <br> <br>
	
If one cigaret can cause this, then imagine "15 billion which is sold on a daily" (World Health Organization). This action has a huge affect on society and the air pollution. <br> <br>
	
I interviewed a biology and chemistry major from UCSB (UC Santa Barbara) and USC (University of Southern California). Laura Chase has earned her teacher credentials and works for an advanced high school, Da Vinci Communications High School, located in Los Angeles, CA. <br> <br>
Laura Chase from Da Vinci High School states " I believe that smoking does contribute to air pollution, but not as [much] as businesses and traffic from cars. Although smoking is the least effective, it should be stopped because it is also bad for the health, terrible for the environment, and people. Yes, I have been around constant smokers, but I did not let their decisions to smoke effect me. Besides, the trend of today to smoke has decreased by a lot from before when smoking was a positive social trend. " <br> <br>
	
Successful solutions that exist today are the "e-cigs" which are vaporized and consist of nicotine. This is better for the environment by the smoke not having a negative impact on people surrounding the smoker.  <br> <br>
	
As time passes, scientist will find even more solutions to smoking which will also help decrease the amount of smoking and air pollution that exist in cities with high air pollution levels. <br> <br>
	
As of today, this situation is being resolved.  A few actions people could start to do is reduce the amount of smoking in the teen generation, and support the "Go Green!" movements . <br> <br>

Many people agree that air pollution is increasing by the movement which encourages people to want to help their society be more of a safer place to live. <br> <br>

According to Megan Gannon, a Live Science Contributor, mentions "The respondents who said they had been exposed to pollution were more likely to pick up green habits like recycling, the researchers explained" (Gannon 2012). <br> <br>

People are very much aware of the different movements to help the environment and people's health in the long run. <br> <br>

If everyone were to contribute something to the environment to help decrease the amount of pollution in the environment, then there would be one less problem in society. <br> <br>

Now it is up to everyone else, to take action in making the world a better place to live.
