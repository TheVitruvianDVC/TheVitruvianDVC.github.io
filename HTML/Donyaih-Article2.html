										<center><i>Kids from Generation Z take a selfie </i> </center>
										  <p>In January, I was a witness of the Martin Luther King Jr. Parade shooting in Los Angeles, California. Before the situation occurred, kids from ages approximately starting from 13 to 17 were not allowed in certain places of the mall. The Los Angeles Police Department began to enforce the laws throughout the mall because it was so chaotic. The police became aggressive by forcing people out of the mall. <br> <br>

It was very disturbing to see the police act in such ways as "belligerent" or hostile on a holiday to celebrate the life of a man that opened the door to our freedom and rights. <br> <br>
	
The way that the younger kids were acting in the mall was a little surprising compared to the way I would have acted when I was in the same age group a few years ago. There is a big difference in the way that each individual age group acts as a group. Certain ways that 13 year olds of today would respond to would not be the same as how the 17 year olds and 18 year olds of today would have responded to certain situations when they were of that age group a while back. <br> <br>
For an example, 13 year olds tend to grow older learning how to positively impact the world depending on if their age group agrees to follow along. They may intend to throw parties now rather than when I was 13, and I was excited to be awarded with candy in class. This is proving that time is adjusting to young children to do more of a mature action. <br> <br>

Millennials by definition are a person reaching young adulthood around the year 2000.  As the authors Neil Howe and William Strauss a renowned speaker, writer, historian, and an authority on generational change in American history etc of "Millennials Go to College", Strauss states "Millennials have driven down teen suicide rates, teen pregnancy and abortion, violent crime and drug use among teensâ€¦ aptitude test scores for this group has risen across all grade levels, and the pressure to succeed has risen like-wise." <br> <br>  
	
Understanding that each year of the Generation Z, the cohort of people born between 1990s to modern time, call respond to situations differently whether they are positive or negative. Throughout the years, the generation will introduce the world into a new lifestyle.
